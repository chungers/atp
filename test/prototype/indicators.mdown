# Indicators and Signals

## Design
Indicators are

+ Some derived value that is a function of the time series, of `x[t]` and
`x[t-1]`, `x[t-2]`, ...
+ The time series `x` can be any of
  + bid
  + ask
  + last_trade
  + bid_size
  + ask_size
  + last_trade_size
+ Since data arrives at uneven intervals, the data must be regularized with
respect to time.  We can use standard aggregation techniques of hloc (candle -
hi/lo/open/close) for some configurable time interval (e.g. 1 sec or 10 msec).
+ If we normalize `x` using the hloc technique above, then we'd usually use the
closing value of all intervals.
+ Indicators only read the time series `x` to derive a computed value.  It can
keep a history of previous computed values.
+ Since indicators do not mutate the time series, they can be parallelized via
executor pool.
+ Indicators are to maintain a history so that signals can be computed off
some historical values of them.

Signals are, on the other hand:
+ A computed value, a function of, the indicators at time `t` or `t-1`, ...
+ Cannot be computed until all of the indicators it depends upon have been
computed.  This implies some implementation using futures, if the indicator
computations are to be parallelized.
+ Signals are then used to derive
  + yes/no decision to enter a trade
  + potentially determine the trade sizing (probably not common initially).
